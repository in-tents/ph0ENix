# Minecraft Smart Contract Government Theory v2.0

## Core Philosophy
Self-dissolving governance system designed to bootstrap cooperative infrastructure then gracefully exit. A temporary scaffolding for civilization, not a permanent institution.

## Economic Model

### Phase 1: Time Bank Bootstrap
- Initial quota-based posting rights create forced interdependence
- Players accumulate "cooperation debt" through bounty submissions
- Must complete others' bounties before posting new ones
- Time debt convertible to resources at algorithmic rates
- **Reverse auction mechanism**: Bounties are first come first serve, waiting means someone else can grab it
- Pre-made tutorials with deterministic block patterns enable automated verification

### Phase 2: Resource Economy Transition
- Conversion rates: 10-minute gathering baseline per resource type
- Quarterly rate reviews with emergency adjustment protocols
- Government targets specific resources through dynamic pricing
- Infinite resource assumption prevents scarcity-based hoarding

### Phase 3: Dissolution Triggers
- Infrastructure completion milestones reduce government posting frequency
- Time bank gradually phases out as resource abundance increases
- System designed to become irrelevant once basic needs are met
- Success = obsolescence

## Mechanics

### Bounty Flow
```
Government Posts → +1 Time Bank Credit per day no completed → First to claim receives reward  after completion → 
Block Pattern Verification → Payment + Time Credit → 
System Decay as Infrastructure Completes
```

### Anti-Gaming Features
- Daily inflation creates cooperative competition, whoever does the work is willing to recieve the payment offered
- Publically claimable bounties prevents speculation cartels
- Explicit, predetermined bounty specifications (block patterns, human and/or machine verification) prevent quality disputes
- Tutorial standardization removes subjective judgment

## Expected Emergent Behaviors

### Competitive Phase
- Underbidding races for time credits
- Speed-running optimization of tutorial builds
- Parallel private economies for creative work

### Cooperative Phase
- Guild formation for bounty batching
- Informal reputation networks
- Resource pooling despite system competition

### Post-Government Phase
- ph0ENix is reduced to ashes, whatever emerges is up to the players

## Key Design Principles
1. **Temporary by design** - success means dissolution
2. **Competition creates cooperation** - anyone (who doesn't owe the timebank) can claim bounties at any value at any time
3. **Shameful inflation** - rising bounty prices broadcast collective failure
4. **Exit over voice** - players can leave rather than reform
5. **Tutorial determinism** - removes governance from aesthetic decisions

## Critical Assumptions
- Infinite resources (Minecraft-specific)
- Zero survival pressure
- Low exit costs
- Players value time credits initially
- Basic governance infrastructure has finite endpoint
- Players continue to utilize decentralized resource management systems

## Success Metrics
- Time to infrastructure completion
- System dissolution speed post-completion
- Spontaneous organization persistence after government ends
- Player retention through full cycle

## Theoretical Implications

### For Virtual Economies
- Demonstrates viability of self-terminating governance
- Tests whether artificial competition can bootstrap genuine cooperation
- Explores post-scarcity organizational dynamics

### For Real-World Application
- **Limitation**: Requires infinite resources (impossible IRL)
- **Insight**: Temporary institutions might solve coordination better than permanent ones
- **Warning**: Reverse auction mechanics create poverty traps with real scarcity
- **Possibility**: Could work for digital/intellectual labor where reproduction cost approaches zero

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Requirements
- Smart contract system or trusted admin for escrow
- Block pattern detection plugin/mod
- Tutorial library with deterministic build patterns
- Time tracking and credit system
- Automated bounty inflation algorithm

### Social Requirements
- Ideally more than 1 player
- Shared understanding of temporary nature
- Agreement on "good enough" infrastructure endpoints
- Cultural acceptance of standardized aesthetics for public works

### Failure Modes
- Insufficient initial participation
- Players reject tutorial aesthetics
- System doesn't dissolve (government addiction)
- Parallel economies completely bypass official system
- Griefing/sabotage of completed infrastructure

## Conclusion
The system intentionally creates its own obsolescence - a government that governs best by ceasing to exist once its purpose is served. It's not about creating perfect governance, but about creating *just enough* governance to bootstrap cooperation, then getting out of the way.
