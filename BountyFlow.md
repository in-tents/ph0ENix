Streamer streams

Clipper clips

Editor edits

AVF reviews and publishes

### AVF selects a stream VOD, creates initial bounties
 - "Go through this video and pull out clips"

 - First Clipper to post a clip is given credit for it but only if used
 - If a single highlight is distributed across multiple clips, the reward is split among clippers

 - Streamer compensated per clip used
 - Clipper compensated per clip they extracted that is used

### AVF approves clips for editing
 - "Turn this clip into a short"
 - "Turn these highlights into a compilation"

 - Editors compensated per clip edited, not per video published
 - Editors are compensated later down the road as well ([CTR%]% of the video's watchtime for the month for the first 3 months(?))
 - Streamers are compensated later down the road as well ([Engagement rate]% of the video's watchtime for the month for the first 3 months(?))
 - Sponsored segments are split 70% to the streamer, 15% to the editor, 15% split between clippers

### AVF approves shorts/compilations for publishing
 - All revenue goes into the treasury
   - Ad revenue, sponsors, product sales, direct donations
  

Perhaps the clips are approved once they exceed [10% of views on the clip] upvotes on the discord, which triggers clipper compensation.

Will update numbers as we iterate, let us first fuck around.
